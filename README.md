This Julia package is work in progress. It offers support for calculations involving GKM spaces, including their equivariant Gromov–Witten invariants.

It comes with the supporting article: Daniel Holmes and Giosuè Muratore, Computations in Equivariant Gromov–Witten theory of GKM spaces.

The package is divided in two parts. The first one deals with foundational material on [GKM spaces](GKM/GKM.md) in general. The second part is dedicated to the computation of [equivariant Gromov–Witten invariants](GW/GW.md), [equivariant quantum cohomology](GW/QH.md) and [equivariant Seidel elements (shift operators)](GW/SeidelElements.md).

We also include in this documentation all [examples from the article](Article/BPS.md) where this is necessary to make them reproducible.

We refer to the documentation page for [installation instructions](https://mgemath.github.io/GKMtools.jl/stable/).
