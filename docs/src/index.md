# GKMtools.jl
*A Julia package for GKM spaces and their equivariant Gromov--Witten theory.*

This Julia package is work in progress. It offers support for calculations involving GKM spaces, including their equivariant Gromov-Witten invariants. It requires Oscar. See https://www.oscar-system.org/install/.

It comes with the supporting article: (Work in Progress...)

The package is divided in two parts. The first one deals with foundational material on [GKM spaces](GKM/GKM.md) in general. The second part is dedicated to the computation of [equivariant Gromov–Witten invariants](GW/GW.md), [equivariant quantum cohomology](GW/QH.md) and [equivariant Seidel elements (shift operators)](GW/SeidelElements.md).

We also include in this documentation all [examples from the article](Article/BPS.md) where this is necessary to make them reproducable.

See the github page for installation instructions.
This version is version 0.11.1.
