# Curve Classes

Given a GKM variety $X$, every edge $e$ of its GKM graph corresponds to a $T$-invariant rational curve $C_e$ in $X$, and hence to a second
homology class $[C_e]\in H_2(X;\mathbb{Z})$.
As we discuss in the supporting paper, it turns out that:

  1. The subgroup of $H_2(X;\mathbb{Z})$ generated by $\{[C_e] : e \text{ an edge of the GKM graph}\}$ coincides with the subgroup generated
      by algebraic cycles.
  2. The weights of the GKM graph give rise to an explicit presentation of this subgroup in terms of a complete set of relations between the $[C_e]$ classes.

This is the basis on which this package handles curve classes of GKM spaces.
